details:                     

No CI yet.

The CI server is not building assign2 yet. Please fix build.sh to point to assign2 directory to build. If you need help with that please ask.

Please do not commit files and directories generated during the build, like htmlcov.

Reading a file is the least interesting bit, let's start with an action that will get us directly into designing the logic. Please see suggestions in files.
