synopsis: good so far

details:

Good so far.

Let's move forward to create the console program

When the program is run, let's read a blocks.txt file from within assign4/data directory. Let the file have the blocks, in sequence: uppercase converter, Z blocker, multiplier

When the program is run, let us list the blocks the user has chosen, in sequence.

Then ask user for a text and display the output of the text processed.
